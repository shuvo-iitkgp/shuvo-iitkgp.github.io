## Overview
Participated in **HackGT 12 (Crypt of Data)** at **Georgia Tech, Atlanta**, where our team developed **BackpackMate AI** — a phone-agent travel planner integrating **Mastra** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and real-time **map APIs**.

The system allowed users to chat with an AI assistant that generated optimized itineraries, recommended routes, and summarized trips automatically — all within 48 hours.

Though not selected among finalists, this hackathon provided **valuable hands-on experience** in deploying full-stack **LLM systems** under rapid prototyping constraints.

## Highlights
- Designed **multi-turn conversational flows** for personalized travel recommendations.  
- Built an **RAG pipeline** connecting OpenAI APIs with contextual retrieval via Mastra.  
- Implemented **API routing** for Google Maps integration and summarized itineraries using FastAPI.  
- Created a minimal **dashboard interface** to visualize generated trips.
