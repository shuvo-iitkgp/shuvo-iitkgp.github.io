## Overview
Participated in **Open IIT Data Analytics Hackathon 2021**, sponsored by **Brillio**, where our team developed a predictive model to estimate the **popularity of 4000+ songs** to assist a media company in optimizing its bidding strategy for maximizing revenue.  
We achieved **1st position out of 48 teams**.

## Project Details
- Built a **Voting Classifier** combining **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Classifier**, and **Gradient Boosting**.  
- Achieved **91.2 % accuracy** on the test set.  
- Predicted optimal song bidding strategy, generating a simulated revenue of **10,500 units**, which was **85 % of the theoretical maximum possible**.  
- The approach balanced interpretability and ensemble performance, making it suitable for real-time music analytics.
