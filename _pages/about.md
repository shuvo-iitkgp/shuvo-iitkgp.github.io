# 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m **Subhajit Bag**, a graduate student at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, pursuing an **M.S. in Analytics** (expected December 2026).  
I’m passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Interpretable AI**, and **Graph Representation Learning**, and I aim to use these tools to uncover deeper insights from complex data.

My long-term goal is to pursue a **Ph.D. in Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence**, contributing to the advancement of human knowledge through research at the intersection of **ML theory**, **explainability**, and **data-driven decision systems**.
