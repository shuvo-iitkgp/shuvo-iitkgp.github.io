My first research paper, published in *Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (2023)*, proposed **SENE** — a novel manifold learning technique for analyzing distracted driving.

We developed a method that learns **spatio-temporal embeddings** from driver behavior and road data, enabling interpretable risk mapping across urban areas.

Key takeaways:
- Combined **spatio-temporal** and **praxeological** features for the first time.
- Reduced high-dimensional driving data into meaningful manifolds.
- Achieved **91% accuracy** in predicting distraction-related risk.

### Why it matters
Distracted driving is one of the top causes of accidents. SENE helps policymakers and insurance companies identify high-risk regions and understand *why* certain driving behaviors lead to accidents — not just *that* they do.
