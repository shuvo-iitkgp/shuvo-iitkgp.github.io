Books have shaped how I approach ML — not just as a technical field, but as a way of thinking.

Here are 5 that deeply influenced me:
1. **The Master Algorithm** by Pedro Domingos — A grand tour of learning paradigms.
2. **The Alignment Problem** by Brian Christian — A must-read on ethics and interpretability.
3. **Deep Learning** by Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville — The bible of neural networks.
4. **Weapons of Math Destruction** by Cathy O’Neil — The societal side of data.
5. **How Minds Change** by David McRaney — Essential for anyone who communicates ideas.

### Why it matters
These books helped me see ML as more than code — as a philosophy of learning and understanding.  
If you’re early in your ML journey, start with *The Alignment Problem* — it will change the way you see “responsible AI.”
