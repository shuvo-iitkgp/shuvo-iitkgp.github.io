Hackathons have been among the best learning experiences of my career.  

I’ve participated in two major ones:
- 🏆 **Open IIT Data Analytics (2021)** — *1st place out of 48 teams*. Built a music popularity predictor with Voting Classifiers (91.2% accuracy).
- 💡 **HackGT 12 (2025)** — Built *BackpackMate AI*, a travel assistant using Mastra + LangChain + FastAPI.

### Lessons learned
- **Speed ≠ sloppiness** — rapid iteration teaches clarity under pressure.
- **LLMs are only as smart as your pipeline** — retrieval design matters more than model choice.
- **Losing is learning** — HackGT taught me far more than winning IIT.

Hackathons show recruiters that you can go from *idea to prototype* in hours — a skill that translates directly into startup and research settings.
