My recent publication in *Decision Support Systems (Elsevier, 2025)* focuses on **temporal knowledge graph-based explainable DSS** for cybersecurity.

We created a dataset of cybersecurity policies from 190 global firms and built a **temporal knowledge graph** to capture entity relations over time. The model then used attention-based mechanisms to classify policy vulnerabilities.

Highlights:
- Introduced the first **temporal cybersecurity policy dataset**.
- Automated attention unit selection for interpretability.
- Developed an explainable DSS that identifies and explains vulnerabilities.

### Why it matters
Modern enterprises face evolving threats. Our framework doesn’t just flag a risky policy — it explains **which rule** and **why** it’s risky, helping companies improve their cybersecurity posture proactively.
